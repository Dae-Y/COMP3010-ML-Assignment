# Introduction

Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosions (BLEVEs) are hazardous phenomena that occur when a pressurised vessel containing liquid above its boiling point ruptures, leading to a rapid phase change and an explosion. Accurately predicting the peak overpressure from a BLEVE event is critical for assessing explosion impact, designing safer storage systems, and protecting nearby infrastructure and personnel.

The assignment aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the peak pressure measured at sensors around BLEVE scenarios.

This report demonstrates a careful preprocessing approach, feature engineering and normalisation techniques that are applied to enhance learning. A total of 3 different models are evaluated to select the most effective predictor of target pressure.
